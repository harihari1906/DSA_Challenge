# 🚀 TechFusion Challenge – 6 Months of Consistency & Growth

I've joined the **6-Month TechFusion Challenge** to build real, unshakable consistency in my tech foundations.  
This journey isn't just about cracking problems — it's about **Ground a strong foundation**.

## 💡 What's in the Challenge?
- 💻 Daily DSA problem-solving (Striver Sheet + LeetCode)
- 🛠️ Deep dives into System Design (Scalability, Architecture)
- 📚 Core CS subjects: OS, CN, DBMS, and OOP
- 🧠 Weekly progress, milestone tracking, and public accountability

This repo is my open journal — tracking every step, every win, and every lesson.

Let’s go. 🚀
